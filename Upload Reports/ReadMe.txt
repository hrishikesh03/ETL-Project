Upload Reports serve as the output files generated after staging the data. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data accuracy and completeness. 
Here are two key features of Upload Reports:

1. Record count validation check: The report includes a comparison between the record count in the received file and the loaded record count in the database. This validation check helps us identify any discrepancies or potential errors during the data staging process.

2. File received flag for tracking missing Sales reports: The report also contains a "File received" flag, which allows us to track which hubs and brands are missing Sales reports. This information helps us proactively address any gaps in our sales reporting.

By regularly reviewing these Upload Reports, we can ensure that our data is reliable, up-to-date, and reflective of accurate sales figures.
